\title{Predict the IC50 for peptides.}
\usage{
predict_ic50(peptides, mhc_haplotype)
}
\arguments{
\item{mhc_haplotype}{one MHC haplotype, e.g. \code{DRB1_0101}.
See \link{get_netmhc2pan_alleles} for a full list}
}
\value{
a tibble with two columns:
(1) \code{peptide}, which holds the peptide sequence, and
(2) \code{ic50}, which holds the predicted IC50
}
\description{
Predict the half maximal inhibitory concentration (aka IC50) (in nM)
for one or more peptides, where the peptides are used as-is,
instead of split into smaller peptides.
Each peptide must be 15 amino acids at
most (use \link{predict_ic50s} to predict the IC50s for longer peptides)
}
\note{
this function uses a temporary file, because NetMHC2pan reads its
input from file. This temporary file is deleted after this function
passed successfully.
